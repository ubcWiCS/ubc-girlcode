          Your job is to integrate your team's skills in data science, computer
          science, design and product management to come up with a product that
          can be used to forward the fashion-tech industry through the lens of
          Aritzia. We encourage you to spend some time researching other brands,
          latest e- commerce news and apps for inspiration, as well as Aritziaâ€™s
          current strategies, mission, and both their online and in-store
          experiences. Think about current events in the tech world and how they
          can be integrated to define what it means to have and maintain a
          leading role in the fashion x tech world.
